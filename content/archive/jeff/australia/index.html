        began with an 18-hour flight to Melbourne, which I was
        dreading because I'd never been on a plane more than 5
        hours, and that was a miserable experience! Thankfully,
        my dad had the foresight to book us in Business Class.
        Let me tell you, if you ever fly international, GO
        BUSINESS CLASS!! It is more than worth the expense. Our
        seats were on the secluded upper deck of the massive 747,
        complete with lazy boy-style reclining chairs, individual
        TV monitors, headphones, slippers and slumbermasks.
        Shortly after takeoff we were treated to a surprisingly
        delicious dinner of smoked salmon w/capers, garden salad,
        shrimp stir-fry w/snap peas, caramel brownie fudge tart,
        wine and coffee. We then reclined our chairs and slept
        peacefully most of the night until we were awakened by
        the smells of hot coffee, spinach and mushroom omelets,
        and fresh fruit. This is the way to travel!</p>

        border="1" width="110" height="75"></a> </p>
        <p>We spent our first three days in Melbourne, culture
        and restaurant capital of Australia. We took a driving
        tour through the Dandenong Mountains, which are thick
        with mountain ash, the second tallest trees in the world
        next to the California redwoods. A brief wallaby (small
        kangaroo) sighting proved to be one of the few we had the
        entire trip, aside from several lizards and exotic birds.
        We drove on through the Yarra Valley, where some of
        Australia's best wines are produced, and toured three
        local vineyards tucked away in the rolling green hills of
        the Valley. We enjoyed several tastings of some fabulous
        vintages and had lunch at Fergusson's winery, where I
        seized my first opportunity to try emu, a local delicacy.
        Emu is a large bird similar to an ostrich that tastes
        very much like beef. While in Melbourne, I also sampled
        another exotic dish, seared kangaroo. Again, very tasty
        similar to beef. For some reason, I had the impression
        that kangaroos were a protected species that the Aussies
        wouldn't dare eat, but according to the locals, they have
        reached near plague-like numbers and are very destructive
        to crops and topsoil. You do need a special permit to
        hunt them, but it is relatively easy to obtain and allows
        you to take out as many as 300 of the little buggers at a
        time! Our last night in Melbourne we toured the city
        aboard the historic Tram Car Restaurant, a 1920's-era
        railcar that has been refurbished and converted into a
        rolling restaurant. It's quite an elegant production, if
        a bit impractical. The ride was, as you can imagine, not
        a smooth one and some of the areas we traveled through
        were suspect. However, the food was delicious, and aside
        from being mistaken for a gay couple, it was an enjoyable
        evening!</p>

        <p>Our next stop was Ayers Rock, located in the Red
        Center of Australia, otherwise known as the Outback. It
        was hot as Hades in Ayers Rock, similar to Arizona in the
        summer, and the intense sun made it seem even hotter. The
        two geological icons of this region are Ayers Rock and
        The Olgas, or Uluru (oo-loo-ROO) and Kata Tjuta (KAH-tah
        JOO-tah) to the Aborigines, the native people of the
        land. Before arriving, we had intended to climb Uluru, a
        1000 ft. red sandstone monolith that rises out of the
        infinitely flat desert floor. This rock is quite amazing,
        creating its own weather patterns and mini ecosystems
        around its base. The Aborigines have long revered this
        place as the holiest of holy, believing all life comes
        from Uluru, and they worship it accordingly. After
        hearing our guide speak about its religious significance
        and after visiting the Aboriginal cultural center where
        this view was reinforced, we realized it was a sacred
        place and climbing it would be blasphemy. I'm not a
        religious man, but I do consider myself spiritual, and
        out of respect, we did NOT climb it. Instead, we bought
        patches for our backpacks from the cultural center that
        say &quot;I Did NOT Climb Uluru!&quot; We completed our
        experience in the Red Center at the &quot;Sounds of
        Silence&quot; dinner held on a large mesa overlooking the
        rocks. The night began with a champagne toast at sunset
        accompanied by a digeridoo player, followed by an
        elaborate four-course meal by candlelight. We enjoyed
        crocodile (a bit like chicken, only tougher) salad, emu
        sausages, lamb shanks, kangaroo loin and a multitude of
        deserts, including macadamia nut pie. Yummy! It was our
        best meal by far, except for the multitude of insects
        trying to share our meals. After dinner, the candles were
        blown out and an astronomer took us on a fascinating tour
        of the crystal clear sky, bright with the light of a
        billion stars.</p>

        border="1" width="75" height="110"></a></p>
        <p>Our next stop was a visit to Cairns (pronounced CANS),
        a tropical sweatbox on the Northeast coast surrounded by
        lush rainforest, where the humidity was a stifling 95%.
        It was quite an adjustment just having come from the
        driest place on the continent. I dragged my dad on a hike
        up the 1000 ft. Mt. Whitfield because of the promise of
        great views of the beaches and city. The steep trail was
        overgrown in places with sharp grasses and impenetrable
        brush, and the humidity was suffocating. This having been
        our first strenuous exercise since we arrived, our pace
        to the top was less than brisk. People we met along the
        trail proclaimed, &quot;It's worth it, mates&quot;,
        sensing we needed a little motivation after seeing our
        sweat-drenched scowls. However, when we arrived at the
        top, the view was obscured by soaring trees and brush,
        although we did have a nice view of the airport
        (yippee!). Oh well, what's that saying&#133;It's all
        about the journey, not the destination? Right&#133;</p>

        border="1" width="125" height="75"></a></p>
        <p>The highlight of the trip for me was an excursion to
        Agincourt Reef, one of the many smaller coral reefs that
        make up the Great Barrier Reef. My dad lounged on the sun
        deck and I chose to snorkel. My first time in the water
        was less than enjoyable as I was stung about a dozen
        times by box jellyfish forcing me from the water after
        only 15 minutes. Feeling soundly defeated, I overheard
        someone say &quot;stinger suits&quot; were available,
        which is something like a wet suit, only much lighter
        weight, that protects swimmers from jellyfish. I donned a
        two-tone bright blue suit, which made me look like
        Aquaman's bastard cousin! Feeling a new sense of
        invulnerability, I purchased an underwater camera and
        went back into the warm, clear water where I spent the
        next two hours swimming among the breathtaking coral and
        tropical fish. A most enjoyable time! I returned to land,
        however, a little dizzy from the relatively rough seas
        and didn't regain my &quot;land legs&quot; until the
        following morning. </p>

        alt="Sunbathing at the Canberra Botanical Gardens"
        border="1" width="125" height="75"></a></p>
        <p>Our next stop was Canberra (pronounced CAN-bra),
        capital of Australia. The weather there was a nice
        departure from our previous days in Ayers Rock and
        Cairns...72 and mild! Canberra is the only truly planned
        city in Australia, having been carved out of the bush
        halfway between Sydney and Melbourne because those two
        cities could not agree on which would be the capital, and
        therefore exists for no other reason. In fact, families
        were deliberately relocated there to colonize the city
        once it was completed. Canberra is the government seat of
        Australia and bears a striking resemblance to Washington
        D.C. The center of town is the Parliament Building and
        everything radiates out from there in circular streets
        and other geometric configurations. Even their monuments
        are erected in perfect lines of sight from each other
        similar to The Mall in D.C. There's not much to do in
        Canberra, so our one-day stay was plenty. We toured the
        botanical gardens, a few government buildings and the War
        Memorial.</p>

        alt="The awe-inspiring architecture of the Sydney Opera House"
        border="1" width="125" height="75"></a></p>
        <p>Our final stop was Sydney. My dad and I found
        ourselves a little lost as to what to do in the cities.
        Neither of us is what some would call cultured, so the
        museums and art galleries were not high on our
        &quot;must-see&quot; list. However, Sydney is a beautiful
        city with many sites to see. We took a driving tour of
        the city, complete with a fish-n-chips lunch on the
        water, but the weather was gray and gloomy, so few photo
        ops presented themselves. The weather did clear up nicely
        for us the following day and we took a scenic cruise on
        the magnificent Sydney harbor aboard a 40ft. sailboat. We
        also toured the Botanical Gardens, which is known for
        it's huge population of fruit bats that hang from the
        trees like ornaments on Dracula's Christmas tree and
        screech like nails on a chalkboard. Creepy! Our last day,
        deciding a little culture wouldn't kill us, we toured the
        famed Sydney Opera House. It's architecture is nothing
        short of spectacular, and it is one of those unique
        landmarks that immediately identifies a city. That night
        we dined on barramundi (tasty fish) and mahi mahi, before
        indulging in single malt scotch and fine Cuban cigars. I
        could think of no better way to end a superb trip.</p>
        <p><a href="/australia/plane.JPG" target="new"><img
        src="/australia/plane.JPG"
        alt="Homeward bound - in style!" border="1" width="125"
        height="75"></a> </p>
        <p>The flight back to the states was just as luxurious,
        but much less relaxing. Perhaps the realization that we
        were returning to the real world was disturbing our
        peace, or perhaps we were excited to see family and
        friends and share the tales of our journey. For me, I was
        anxious to return to my new fiancée, who I had been away
        from for two long weeks. We dined on filet mignon and
        seafood ragout in the evening while enjoying a movie
        before drifting off for a restless night's sleep. The
        omelets, fruit and Starbucks coffee for breakfast helped
        clear the morning daze as we looked out the window and
        finally touched down on U.S. soil.</p>
        <p>I hope you all enjoyed our adventure as much as my dad
        and I enjoyed living it!. Cheers, mates!</p>
